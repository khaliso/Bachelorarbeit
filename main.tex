-> was für information needs wurden in der normalen Literatur aufgedeckt?

Wie bereits von \cite{oduntan2017investigating} festgestellt wurde, ..

The identified information needs of general migrant
include: social, cultural knowledge and skill-based
knowledge (Fisher, Durrance, & Hinton, 2004); health
insurance, emergency care, vaccinations, dental, preventive
care, pregnancy, what to expect from health services,
school enrolment, housing and employment (Courtright,
2005). Silvio (2006) identified academic, apprenticeship,
health, employment, political and how to deal with
discrimination and Shoham & Strauss (2008) identified
housing, schooling, health, driving, banking, legal issues,
work and language. Lingel (2011) identified information
need around neighborhood, grocery shopping, local routes,
libraries and hospitals. These studies also identified a broad
range of information sources that included family and
friends (Shoham & Strauss, 2008) and social networks such
as ball parks, bike shops, day care centers, church, barber
shops, hair salons and garage (Fisher et al., 2004).

However, these information needs are at an individual-level
and are set within certain specific confined instances.
Individual-level information needs isolate the studied from
either others in a process and surrounding contextual factors
of situations. For instance, Fisher et al. (2004) studied the
use of library programs by the Queens Borough public
library and Courtright (2005) studied health information
seeking investigation of Latino newcomers to Southern
Indiana in the United States. Similarly, Shoham & Strauss
(2008) investigated the information needs of new
immigrants’ families from North America to Israel and
Lingel (2011) studied new immigrants at an international
center.
The refugee specific studies includes the work of Lloyd,
Kennan, Thompson, & Qayyum (2013) that identified
information needs around everyday living and compliance,
and Lloyd (2014) that identified health information needs.
The information sources identified included trusted
mediators, social networks and visual sources. These
studies, like the general migrants studies, were individual-
level and set within confined instances: Lloyd (2014)
studied African refugees and focused on health while Lloyd
et al. (2013) studied newly arrived refugees. In this study,
we examine contextual and individual variables including
sociological processes in refugee integration for the
identification of refugee information needs.

Although information needs, sources and seeking behaviour
have indeed been identified, they do not address the
processes and procedural dimensions involved. This may be
attributed to Wilson (1981) observation of “a failure to
identify with the situations within which information needs
investigations are carried out”. It is advocated that a holistic
approach to migrant information studies be adopted,
encompassing closer examination of theories and principles
of social inclusion and social capital in addition to
information behaviour (Caidi, Allard, & Quirke, 2010).

Information behaviour studies being person-centred need
not only identify individual-level information needs. The
scope of identified information needs can be broadened. A
situational approach to information behaviour during
refugee integration can provide fuller perspectives to help
understand the relationships between contextual factors and
human information behaviour in situations which can be
used in the actual design of services and provision. This is
because information needs identified from situations put
any potential person in context.
